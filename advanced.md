# Advanced Usage Guide for the AutoGluon-Based Imputer Package

This guide explores advanced features and customizations available in the AutoGluon-Based Imputer Package, enabling users to handle more complex imputation tasks effectively.

## Customizing Imputation Settings

### Column-Specific Settings
Users can specify different imputation settings for each column. This includes custom time limits, presets, and evaluation metrics for individual columns.

Example:
```python
column_settings = {
    'MedInc': {'time_limit': 120, 'presets': 'best_quality', 'eval_metric': 'mean_squared_error'},
    'HouseAge': {'time_limit': 60, 'presets': 'medium_quality'}
}

imputer = Imputer(column_settings=column_settings)
train_imputed = imputer.fit(train_missing)
```

### Using Missingness Features
The imputer can add features indicating the missingness of other columns, which might help in certain imputation scenarios.

```python
imputer = Imputer(use_missingness_features=True)
train_imputed = imputer.fit(train_missing)
```

### Simple Impute Columns
For columns where predictive imputation might be overkill, specify a list of columns to be imputed using simple strategies (mean or mode).

```python
simple_impute_columns = ['HouseAge', 'AveRooms']
imputer = Imputer(simple_impute_columns=simple_impute_columns)
train_imputed = imputer.fit(train_missing)
```

## Multiple Imputations
Performing multiple imputations can provide a more robust handling of uncertainty in the imputation process.

```python
from autogluonImputer import multiple_imputation
num_iter=2
time_limit=10
train_imputed = multiple_imputation(train_missing, n_imputations=10, num_iter=num_iter, time_limit=time_limit, fitonce=True)
```

## Evaluating Imputation Quality
Evaluate the quality of imputations by introducing controlled missingness and comparing imputed values against true values.

```python
results = imputer.evaluate_imputation(test, percentage=0.1, ntimes=5)
print(results)
```

## Saving and Loading Models
For large datasets or complex models, it's often useful to save trained models and reload them for future imputations.

### Saving Models
```python
imputer.save_models('path/to/save/models')
```

### Loading Models
```python
imputer.load_models('path/to/save/models')
train_imputed = imputer.transform(train_missing)
```

## Feature Importance
Understanding which features are most influential in the imputation can provide insights into your data.

```python
feature_importances = imputer.feature_importance(train_imputed)
print(feature_importances)
```

## Visualizing Imputation
Visualizing the differences between original and imputed values can be a powerful tool for understanding the imputation quality.

```python
# Plotting code as shown in the basic usage guide
```

## Conclusion
This advanced usage guide offers deeper insights into the AutoGluon-Based Imputer Package, enabling users to leverage its full potential for various imputation tasks. Whether dealing with specific column settings, handling multiple imputations, or analyzing feature importance, this guide provides the necessary tools and examples for sophisticated data imputation strategies.
